##  Technologies Used

##  Error Handling

The application shows error pop-up messages for the following situations:

- **Missing Input:**  
  If either the month or year field is left empty, a message like:  
  `"Both month and year fields are required."`

- **Invalid Month/Year Ranges:**  
  If the month is not between `1â€“12`, or the year is not between `1900â€“2100`, the app shows:  
  `"Month must be between 1 and 12."`  
  `"Year must be between 1900 and 2100."`

- **Non-Integer Values:**  
  If the user enters text or non-numeric characters, it triggers a message such as:  
  `"Invalid Input"` followed by a specific explanation.

All errors are displayed using Tkinterâ€™s `messagebox.showerror()` for better user feedback.
